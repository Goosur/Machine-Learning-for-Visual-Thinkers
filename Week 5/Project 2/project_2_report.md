## Dataset
Your dataset -- What does it measure? How is it organized? How did you preprocess and/or clean it?

My dataset measured the follow variables of cars in 2015.

- Make	Manufacturer (e.g. Chevrolet, Toyota, etc.)
- Model:        Car model (e.g. Impala, Prius, ...)
- Type:         Vehicle category (Small, Hatchback, Sedan, Sporty, Wagon, SUV, 7Pass)
- LowPrice:	    Lowest MSRP (in $1,000)
- HighPrice:	Highest MSRP (in $1,000)
- Drive:    	Type of drive (FWD, RWD, AWD)
- CityMPG:  	City miles per gallon (EPA)
- HwyMPG:   	Highway miles per gallon (EPA)
- FuelCap:  	Fuel capacity (in gallons)
- Length:   	Length (in inches)
- Width:    	Width (in inches)
- Height:   	Height (in inches)
- Wheelbase:	Wheelbase (in inches)
- UTurn:    	Diameter (in feet) needed for a U-turn
- Weight:   	Curb weight (in pounds)
- Acc030:   	Time (in seconds) to go from 0 to 30 mph
- Acc060:   	Time (in seconds) to go from 0 to 60 mph
- QtrMile:  	Time (in seconds) to go Â¼ mile
- PageNum:  	Page number in the Consumer Reports New Car Buying Guide
- Size:     	Small, Midsized, or Large

I preprocessed it by filtering out non numeric data in order for stats to be calculated from the data.

## Algorithm
Your algorithm -- How did you design your transformation matrices to normalize by range and by Z-score?

I designed my transformation matrices as we learned in class. For range normalization I translated by -min and scaled by the inverse of the range. For z score normalization I translated by -mean and scaled by the inverse of the standard deviation. I tried to design my functions in a way that I could normalize any sized dataset.

## Visualization
Your visualization technique(s) -- What did you choose to do and why?

I chose to just do the pairplots this time to show that normalizing doesn't affect the way the data looks when plotted. The relationships between variables stay the same and their plots are also the same but on different scales. Normalizing by range brings all data values between 0 and 1. Normalizing by z score brings all data values roughly between -3 and 3

Again the pairplots are rediculously large.

## Results
Your results -- What are the stats (mean, standard deviation, covariance) of the original and normalized datasets? Did normalization help you uncover new patterns in the data, remove outliers, or alleviate another source of bias in your statistics? What did this project help you learn about your dataset and/or machine learning?

Stats for original/normalized datasets below. Through looking at covariance, normalization helped me see just how much variables were related without the different units making things unclear. For example the Acc60 and CityMPG relation is clearer when compared to other variables because of normalization. The z score normalization made it clear that there were some significant outliers in the data. Looking at the mins and maxs of the z score normalization you can see z scores of 3+ which is well outside most of the values of the dataset. Like I mentioned earlier there was lots of unit bias in this dataset and normalization helped eliminate that bias and allow a clearer look at the data. This project helped me learn that normalization is very powerful in machine learning. Eliminating bias and making data easier to work with is very important for analyzing data. This may seem obvious but for me there was a big difference between hearing that it is usefull and normalizing data and seeing the effects myself.
